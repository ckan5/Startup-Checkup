<p>
The Startup Checkup is not a law firm, and the creators or employees of the Startup Checkup are not acting as your attorney. The Startup Checkup’s legal document service is not a substitute for the advice of an attorney. 
</p>

<p>
The Startup Checkup cannot provide legal advice and can only provide self-help services at your specific direction. 
</p>

<p>
The Startup Checkup is not permitted to engage in the practice of law. The Startup Checkup is prohibited from providing any kind of advice, explanation, opinion, or recommendation to a consumer about possible legal rights, remedies, defenses, options, selection of forms or strategies. 
</p>

<p>
This site is not intended to create an attorney-client relationship, and by using the Startup Checkup, no attorney-client relationship will be created with the Startup Checkup. Instead, you are representing yourself in any legal matter you undertake through the Startup Checkup’s legal document service. Communications between you and the Startup Checkup are not protected by the attorney-client privilege or work product doctrine. 
</p>

<p>
The Startup Checkup provides an online legal portal to give visitors a general understanding of the law, as well as to provide an automated software solution to individuals who choose to prepare their own legal documents. To that extent, the site publishes general information on legal issues commonly encountered. 
</p>

<p>
At no time does the Startup Checkup review your answers for legal sufficiency, draw legal conclusions, provide legal advice or apply the law to the facts of your particular situation. The Startup Checkup and its services are not a substitute for the advice of an attorney. 
</p>

<p>
Although the Startup Checkup takes every reasonable effort to ensure that the information on our website and documents are up-to-date and legally sufficient, the legal information on this site is not legal advice and is not guaranteed to be correct, complete or up-to-date. Because the law changes rapidly, is different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and is also subject to varying interpretations by different courts and certain government and administrative bodies, the Startup Checkup cannot guarantee that all the information on the site is completely current. The law is a personal matter, and no general information or legal tool like the kind the Startup Checkup provides can fit every circumstance. 
</p>

<p>
Therefore, if you need legal advice for your specific problem, or if your specific problem is too complex to be addressed by our tools, you should consult a licensed attorney in your area. 
</p>
